- ❌ `/litecoin-withdrawal-and-deposit/unconfirmed-litecoin-deposits`

**Ripple Operations:**
- ❌ `/ripple-withdrawal-and-deposit/withdraw-ripple`
- ❌ `/ripple-withdrawal-and-deposit/ripple-deposit-addresses`
- ❌ `/ripple-withdrawal-and-deposit/unconfirmed-ripple-deposits`

**Cardano Operations:**
- ❌ `/cardano-withdrawal-and-deposit/withdraw-cardano`
- ❌ `/cardano-withdrawal-and-deposit/cardano-deposit-addresses`

**USDT Operations:**
- ❌ `/usdt-withdrawal-and-deposit/*` (multiple endpoints)

**Virtual Currency Operations:**
- ❌ `/virtual-currency-withdrawal-and-deposit/*` (multiple endpoints)

**Fiat Operations:**

## Issues Found in Current Implementation

### 1. Code Quality Issues
- **Typo**: `TraidingPairs` should be `TradingPairs` ✅ **FIXED**
- **Incorrect method receiver**: `GetTradingPairs()` used wrong receiver ✅ **FIXED**
- **Error handling**: Wrapped contextual errors across endpoints ✅ **IMPROVED**
- **Response structures**: Added JSON tags to align with API ✅ **IMPROVED**
- **Request validation**: Added basic validation for required params ✅ **IMPROVED**

### 2. Technical Issues
- **Configurable timeout**: Default 2s; now configurable via `SetTimeout` ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Missing retry logic**: No retry mechanism for failed requests
- **No rate limiting**: No protection against API rate limits
- **Limited logging**: Some `fmt.Println` remain (e.g., request body debug); replace with proper logging

### 3. Documentation Issues
- **Missing examples**: No usage examples in code
- **Incomplete documentation**: Many functions lack proper documentation
- **No API versioning**: No support for different API versions

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Critical Missing Features)
1. **Add withdrawal/deposit endpoints** - Essential for a complete trading client
2. **Add order management endpoints** - Get order by ID, replace orders, cancel all orders
3. **Add trading fees endpoint** - Essential for cost calculations

### Medium Priority (Code Quality)
1. **Introduce retry logic** - Exponential backoff for transient failures
2. **Rate limiting** - Basic token bucket to respect API limits
3. **Improve logging** - Replace `fmt.Println` with structured logging

### Low Priority (Enhancements)
1. **Extend configuration options** - Retries, base URL overrides
2. **Add comprehensive tests** - Continue expanding unit/integration tests
3. **Add examples** - Usage examples in documentation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Endpoints
1. Add `/trader-fees` endpoint
2. Add `/trade-history` endpoint
3. Add `/transaction-history` endpoint

### Phase 2: Order Management
1. Add `/order/get-order-by-orderid` endpoint
2. Add `/order/get-order-by-clientorderid` endpoint
3. Add `/order/replace-existing-order-by-*` endpoints
4. Add `/order/cancel-all-open-orders` endpoint

### Phase 3: Withdrawal/Deposit Operations
1. Start with Bitcoin operations (most common)
2. Add Ethereum operations
3. Add other cryptocurrency operations
4. Add fiat operations

### Phase 4: Code Quality Improvements
1. Improve error handling
2. Add request validation
3. Add retry logic
4. Improve logging

## Conclusion

The client now fully covers public endpoints and key secure trading flows, with improved error handling, validation, and a configurable HTTP timeout. The most critical remaining work centers on withdrawal/deposit operations and advanced secure endpoints.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize secure endpoint expansion (fees, history, order management) and add retry/rate limiting with structured logging. Continue improving tests and documentation.

**Estimated effort**: 2–3 weeks to implement priority secure endpoints with retries, rate limiting, and logging.

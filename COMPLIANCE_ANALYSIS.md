**Ethereum Operations:**
- ❌ `/ethereum-withdrawal-and-deposit/withdraw-ethereum`
- ❌ `/ethereum-withdrawal-and-deposit/ethereum-deposit-addresses`

**Ripple Operations:**
- ❌ `/ripple-withdrawal-and-deposit/withdraw-ripple`
- ❌ `/ripple-withdrawal-and-deposit/ripple-deposit-addresses`
- ❌ `/ripple-withdrawal-and-deposit/unconfirmed-ripple-deposits`

**Cardano Operations:**
- ❌ `/cardano-withdrawal-and-deposit/withdraw-cardano`
- ❌ `/cardano-withdrawal-and-deposit/cardano-deposit-addresses`

**Virtual Currency Operations:**
- ❌ `/virtual-currency-withdrawal-and-deposit/*` (multiple endpoints)

**Fiat Operations:**
- ❌ `/fiat-withdrawal-and-deposit/bankwire-withdrawal`

## Issues Found in Current Implementation

### 1. Code Quality Issues
- **Typo**: `TraidingPairs` should be `TradingPairs` ✅ **FIXED**
- **Incorrect method receiver**: `GetTradingPairs()` used wrong receiver ✅ **FIXED**
- **Missing error handling**: Some endpoints lack proper error handling
- **Inconsistent response structures**: Some responses don't match API documentation
- **Missing request validation**: No validation for required parameters

### 2. Technical Issues
- **Hardcoded timeout**: 2-second timeout might be insufficient for some operations
- **Missing retry logic**: No retry mechanism for failed requests
- **No rate limiting**: No protection against API rate limits
- **Limited logging**: Basic `fmt.Println` instead of proper logging

### 3. Documentation Issues
- **Missing examples**: No usage examples in code
- **Incomplete documentation**: Many functions lack proper documentation
- **No API versioning**: No support for different API versions

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Critical Missing Features)
1. **Add withdrawal/deposit endpoints** - These are essential for a complete trading client
2. **Add missing public endpoints** - `/currencies`, `/ticker-all`, `/server-time`
3. **Add order management endpoints** - Get order by ID, replace orders, cancel all orders
4. **Add trading fees endpoint** - Essential for cost calculations

### Medium Priority (Code Quality)
1. **Improve error handling** - Add proper error types and handling
2. **Add request validation** - Validate required parameters
3. **Add retry logic** - Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
4. **Improve logging** - Replace `fmt.Println` with proper logging

### Low Priority (Enhancements)
1. **Add rate limiting** - Protect against API rate limits
2. **Add configuration options** - Make timeout, retry settings configurable
3. **Add comprehensive tests** - Unit tests for all endpoints
4. **Add examples** - Usage examples in documentation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Endpoints
1. Add `/currencies` endpoint
2. Add `/ticker-all` endpoint
3. Add `/system/get-server-time` endpoint
4. Add `/trader-fees` endpoint
5. Add `/trade-history` endpoint

### Phase 2: Order Management
1. Add `/order/get-order-by-orderid` endpoint
2. Add `/order/get-order-by-clientorderid` endpoint
3. Add `/order/replace-existing-order-by-*` endpoints
4. Add `/order/cancel-all-open-orders` endpoint

### Phase 3: Withdrawal/Deposit Operations
1. Start with Bitcoin operations (most common)
2. Add Ethereum operations
3. Add other cryptocurrency operations
4. Add fiat operations

### Phase 4: Code Quality Improvements
1. Improve error handling
2. Add request validation
3. Add retry logic
4. Improve logging

## Conclusion

The current Go client provides a solid foundation for basic trading operations but is significantly incomplete compared to the official Coinmate API. The most critical missing features are withdrawal/deposit operations and additional public endpoints. 

**Recommendation**: Focus on implementing the missing public endpoints and withdrawal/deposit operations first, as these are essential for a complete trading client. Then improve code quality and add advanced features.

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 weeks to implement all missing endpoints with proper error handling and validation.
